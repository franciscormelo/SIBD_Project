-- For Query 1
Use index on person to find
person.name = 'John Smith' as pvet;
Use index on consult to find
consult.VAT_vet = pvet.VAT;
Use index on animal to find
animal.VAT = consult.VAT_owner and animal.name = consult.name
to test animal.VAT = person.VAT;

These indexes would ease the computational effort in case of a highly populated database, since the main computational expense in this query coincides
with the search on the animal, person and consult tables. 




-- For Query 2
Use index on units to find
units LIKE '%mg%'; test for reference_value > 100 and order by descent
An index on units was chosen to make it computationally easier to find units like %mg%, since the main computational expense in this query is finding strings like %mg%
